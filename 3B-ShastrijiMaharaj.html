				<h3>Invincible Power</h3>
				<p>Gordhanbhai called Swamishri to Vartal and told him to build a mandir in Virsad. Because Swamishri
					had come to Vartal, his devotees also followed. Soon, an assembly of thousands convened before
					Swamishri. Swamishri spoke about the greatness of Akshar- Purushottam. He emphasized the importance
					of serving the cause. He informed them that the murtis of Akshar and Purushottam were soon to be
					consecrated in Vadhwan. He encouraged them to donate for the cause.
					Within moments, two and a half thousand rupees were pledged for the Akshar-Purushottam murtis. Other
					sadhus and even Gord- hanbhai Kothari were unaware of what was taking place. They thought that
					Swamishri was gathering funds for a new mandir in Virsad.
					Swamishri then reached Ahmedabad to meet Nirmaldas. He told him, “We will fund our murtis. When you
					go to Jaipur to have the other murtis made, one of our men will accompany you. Our murtis should be
					made according to our designs.” After he reached a precise agreement, Swamishri sent Purushottamdas,
					a mason devotee of Gondal, to Jaipur.
					Nirmaldas went to Vadodara to have the remaining murtis made. Swamishri asked Kothari Jetha Bhagat,
					of the Vadodara Swaminarayan mandir, to make any necessary arrangements for Nirmaldas. At
					Swamishri’s behest, Jetha Bhagat boldly helped Nirmaldas.
					Swamishri then arrived in Bharuch. He conducted a one-day parayan on the Vachanamrut. A thousand
					devotees from all over Gujarat came to listen. Swamishri spoke extensively about the concept of the
					Sadhu as the gateway to liberation.
					News of Swamishri’s discourses reached Vartal. Those who disliked Swamishri were further enraged.
					“Thousands run after Yagnapurushdasji. They sponsor his meals and serve him, whereas not even five
					devotees gather before us. How can we permit this? Even more, Yagnapurushdasji speaks so openly
					about Akshar-Purushottam. He sides with Nirmaldas. He requests Jetha Bhagat to make arrangements for
					Nirmaldas in Vadodara. Even Gordhanbhai Kothari supports Yagnapurushdasji. If this continues,
					Yagnapurushdasji will control not just Vartal, but the entire Sampradaya. He will become its leader.
					Then, no one will value us.”
					They started plotting to put a stop to Yagnapurushdasji. Swamishri fearlessly continued his efforts.
					Gordhanbhai called Swamishri in Vartal. He warned, “The sadhus here are preparing to do away with
					you. They cannot tolerate your prominence. Wherever you go, there are great celebrations. Thousands
					are drawn to you. The sadhus cannot bear to see this. Therefore, it is better that you limit your
					activities.”
					Swamishri courteously replied, “We gather only for discourses and to worship and remember God. If
					people are drawn to me, if they see greatness, that is the work of Shriji Maharaj. I do not do
					anything against the traditions of Satsang. If you wish to see for yourself, we will now only hold
					discourses in Vartal.”
					Swamishri’s reply pleased Gordhanbhai. He was extremely fond of Swamishri. Furthermore, Gordhanbhai
					saw the improved condition of the mandir, guesthouse, and haveli in Sarangpur. He was impressed by
					Swamishri’s abilities. However, he reasoned that if he appeased the sadhus, they would harass
					Swamishri less. Thus, he relieved Swamishri of his duties in Sarangpur and called him back to
					Vartal.</p>
