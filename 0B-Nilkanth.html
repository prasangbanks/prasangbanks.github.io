				<h3>"Tell My People I Am Safe"</h3>
				<p>It was the morning of 29 June 1792 (Ashadh sud 10, Samvat 1848). The Saryu river on the outskirts of
					Ayodhya was in spate. Kaushik‚ the demon was very pleased with himself. He had reason to be happy.
					He had hurled the 11-year-old Nilkanth Varni in the rampaging river which had burst its banks. His
					master‚ Kaliya‚ had asked him to do the dastardly deed. Kaushik was jumping with joy. He was
					behaving like one intoxicated after a victory. But before he could go to his master to report what
					he considered to be the success of his mission‚ his end came. In his mad frenzy‚ Kaushik dashed
					against a tree which fell on him with a thundering noise and crushed him to death.
					Nilkanth survived the deluge. He passed through a massive wave and landed on the opposite bank. It
					was a miracle as few could have come out alive. The Bal Brahmachari who had a tulsi mala in his hand
					was not at all ruffled by the incident. He was exultant as he had renounced the world that very day
					and snapped all worldly ties. After reaching the bank he started walking. The atmosphere was serene.
					Peacocks and other creatures were making the most of the rain‚ the flood notwithstanding.
					Nilkanth looked splendid. There was a glow on his round‚ tender face. His eyes had a clear vision of
					his goal to redeem souls. His black‚ curly jata‚ and the kamandal in his hand proclaimed to the
					world that a new‚ extraordinary ascetic was born.
					The young Brahmachari walked for some time and reached a banyan tree. He sat in padmasan and started
					meditating. When he opened his eyes‚ he saw Hanumanji before him with folded hands. “How did you get
					here?” the young ascetic asked. “Maharaj‚ I am in the habit of having your darshan daily. I looked
					for you at your house in Ayodhya but I did not find you there. So I searched for you on the bank of
					the Saryu. I did not find you there either. Then I sat in meditation and traced you to this place. I
					am eager to serve you. Now‚ if it is your wish then I will stay with you and serve you.”
					“At present I wish to travel alone. However‚ when I remember you come immediately. And one more
					thing‚ tell the people of Ayodhya that I am safe and well.” And with these words Nilkanth closed his
					eyes in meditation.
				</p>
				<h3> The Attributes Of A Tyagi</h3>
				<p>After leaving home‚ Nilkanth spent the first night under a banyan tree. The next morning on Ashadh
					sud 11‚ as was his practice‚ He got up early‚ performed his ablutions and again sat under the tree.
					Soon the residents of Amarpur village started flocking to the place. They were greatly impressed by
					the calm on the Brahmachari’s face‚ and were debating as to whether Swami Kartikeyiji or Dhruvji had
					come in person. They ran to their homes to get whatever offerings they could lay their hands on.
					Soon there was a pile of fruits‚ sweets and other kinds of eatables. The young ascetic had a
					Shaligram with him. First he made an offering to it and then sparingly ate some of the eatables.
					After this he distributed everything to the assembled villagers. They were greatly surprised by his
					virtue of non-possession. They advised him‚ “Brahmachariji‚ why don’t you keep something for this
					evening.” Nilkanth smiled at them and said‚ “If I were to think about food for this evening or
					tomorrow‚ then what was the point in renouncing my home! A tyagi should be detached like the sky.
					Having renounced with faith in God‚ then God will provide as necessary.” The village folks were
					attracted by Nilkanth’s divine‚ sweet words.
					Then Nilkanth reassured them‚ “Now you may go. I fear no one. My powers prevail in all things.” The
					simple villagers did not understand these divine words of Nilkanth.
					Nilkanth then departed from that place. He crossed riversand dense forests as he progressed in his
					sojourn. Wherever he stopped‚ the villagers were attracted by his divine form. They brought fruits
					and other eatables for him. As usual he would first offer them to Thakorji and then take a little
					for himself.
					He walked northwards towards the Himalayas. He did not remember his brothers‚ sister-in-law and
					friends. He walked briskly‚ looking all the while over his shoulder to see that nobody was pursuing
					him to take him home.
					Nilkanth was God himself. He had no need to do austerities‚ but still he was going to undertake
					austerities for the redemption of countless people.</p>
