				<h3>Birth and Blessings</h3>
				<p>The day for which so many had been praying finally arrived. It was almost noon on Monday, 31 January
					1865 (Maha sud 5, Samvat 1921). On this auspicious day of Vasant Panchmi, in the village of Mahelav,
					in the Charotar region of Gujarat, Shastriji Maharaj was born. His father, Dhoribhai, and his
					mother, Hetba, had two daughters and three sons. Their daughters were Sonaba and Raliyatba, and
					their sons were Mathurbhai, Laldas, and finally little Dungar, who would later be known as Shastriji
					Maharaj. Years ago, their family had been fortunate enough to come in touch with Shriji Maharaj.
					Dungar’s grandfather, Ajubhai Zaveridas Patel, had met Maharaj.
					From a young age, Dungar was very gentle and charming. Everyone was drawn to him. Everyone adored
					him. When Dungar was six months old, Shukanand Swami and Vaikuntanand Brahmachari came to Mahelav.
					Mathurbhai took Dungar to Shukanand Swami. He asked Swami to give vartman, initiation, to little
					Dungar. Dungar gazed up at Swami constantly.
					Shukanand Swami initiated Dungar into the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. Then, placing his hand on
					Dungar’s head, Swami blessed him and said, “He is a very great devotee from his past birth. In the
					future, he will renounce the world, become a sadhu, and liberate your entire family.”
					Mathurbhai returned home with Dungar and related Swami’s words to the entire family. Swami’s
					prediction delighted everyone. The following year, Gunatitanand Swami came to Vartal for the Chaitra
					Punam festival on 31 March 1866 (Chaitra sud 15, Samvat 1922). On his way back to Junagadh, Swami
					passed through Mahelav. Mathurbhai brought little Dungar to Swami and asked him to initiate Dungar.
					Surprised, Swami asked, “Has he still not been initiated?”
					“Actually, he was initiated last year by Shukanand Swami,” Mathurbhai clarified.
					Hearing this, Swami replied, “Shuk Swami is considered the right hand of Shriji Maharaj. So, if Shuk
					Swami has initiated him, consider him to have been initiated by Shriji Maharaj himself.” With these
					words, Gunatitanand Swami placed his hand on Dungar’s head and blessed him.
					He said to Mathurbhai, “Your brother will one day become a sadhu and spread the true glory of Shriji
					Maharaj as the Supreme God. By delivering spiritual discourses he will invigorate and enhance the
					Swaminarayan Sampradaya.”
					Swami looked affectionately at Dungar and gave him a sweet snack as prasad.
