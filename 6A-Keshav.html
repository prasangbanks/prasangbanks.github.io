				<h3>Early Life</h3>
				<p>HH Mahant Swami Maharaj was born to Dahiben and Manibhai Narayanbhai Patel on 13 September 1933
					(Bhadarva vad 9, Samvat 1989) in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India. A few days later, Brahmaswarup
					Shastriji Maharaj, the founder of BAPS, visited Jabalpur, where he blessed the newborn child and
					named him Keshav. His family also lovingly called him Vinu.
					Manibhai was originally a native of Anand in Gujarat and had settled in Jabalpur for business.
					Vinubhai spent his formative years in Jabalpur, completing his primary and secondary education in an
					English-medium school. He was exceptionally brilliant and completed his 12th grade at the Christ
					Church Boys' Senior Secondary School in Jabalpur. Thereafter, he returned with his parents to his
					native town of Anand, where he enrolled to study at the College of Agriculture. Despite his deep
					inner spirituality, his sharp intellect was inclined towards rational and logical reasoning. Only a
					great spiritual master could penetrate his reasoning and awaken the dormant spiritual spark within
					him. In 1951-52, he came into the contact of His Holiness Yogiji Maharaj, the spiritual successor of
					Brahmaswarup Shastriji Maharaj. Impressed by Yogiji Maharaj’s spiritual charisma and selfless love,
					he traveled with Yogiji Maharaj during his summer vacations. Yogiji Maharaj's love drew the young
					Vinubhai closer towards him.
					Vinubhai graduated with a bachelor’s degree in agriculture from Anand and through his association
					with Yogiji Maharaj he was inspired to take the path of renunciation. In 1957, Yogiji Maharaj gave
					him parshad diksha and renamed him Vinu Bhagat. Then, Yogiji Maharaj told him to accompany him in
					his vicharan to look after his daily correspondence and other services.
