				<h3>Birth</h3>
				<p>In the mid-18th century, Atmanand Swami travelled throughout the holy land of Saurashtra, in Gujarat,
					which is famous as the land of sadhus. Some of his devotees lived in the village of Latipur in Halar
					district (near Jamnagar). One of the devotees was Vallabhji Jani. A son, Bholanath, was born to him
					by the blessings of Swami. Similarly, a daughter, Sakarba, was born to Sukhdev Dave, who was also a
					devotee of Atmanand Swami. Both families were delighted with their newborn children. With the
					passage of time, and as instructed by Atmanand Swami, Bholanath and Sakarba joined each other in
					wedlock. Atmanand Swami blessed Bholanath on his wedding ceremony.
					Some time later Atmanand Swami appointed his chief disciple, Ramanand Swami, as his successor and
					ordered everybody to obey him. Having done this, he passed away.
					After the death of their parents, Bholanath and Sakarba lived a happily married life in the
					beautiful village of Bhadra, situated on the banks of the river Und. Bholanath had deep faith in the
					deity Shiv. Sakarba, on the other hand, was a staunch devotee of Bhagwan Krishna. Yet, both of them
					cooperated with each other and worshipped their own deities. The couple was happy in all respects,
					but there was one thing lacking in their life; they had no son. The couple decided to go to
					Prabhaskshetra, in order to please and pray to Bholanath – Shivaji – to fulfil their desire for a
					son.
					Bholanath and Sakarba set out for Prabhas with a group of pilgrims from their own village. They made
					a night halt at a Patel’s house in the village of Mekhatimbi. The date was 1 April 1781 (Chaitra sud
					8, Samvat 1837).
					Patel had a heart-to-heart talk with Bholanath, who was a simple man and was one of the pilgrims who
					had put up at his place. In the course of their conversation Patel came to know that both Bholanath
					and his wife had set out on a pilgrimage with a desire to get a son. Patel was a staunch follower of
					Atmanand Swami. So he told Bholanath, “Remember Atmanand Swami and your desire will certainly be
					fulfilled.”
					On hearing this, there was a spark in Bholanath’s heart. He remembered the blessings which Atmanand
					Swami had given him on the occasion of his sacred thread ceremony.
					That same night Sakarba had a dream in which she had a vision of Atmanand Swami. Swami gave his
					blessings and said, “Tomorrow, Bhagwan Purushottam will take birth at Dharmadev’s house in the
					Sarvar region; and four years from now, Akshar, the abode of God, will take birth as your child. So
					there is no need for you to go to Prabhas.”
					Sakarba woke up with a start. Akshar, the abode of God, would be born as her son! The joy of this
					couple knew no bounds after receiving the blessings. They left the group of pilgrims and returned
					home. They had faith in Atmanand Swami’s words and passed their days happily. And then that
					auspicious day arrived!
					At Bholanath’s home on 17 October 1785 (Aso sud Punam, Samvat 1841), Sakarba gave birth to a son who
					was the incarnation of Akshar, the abode of Purushottam. The people of Bhadra rejoiced when they
					heard this good news in the delightful atmosphere of the Sharad season. After his early morning
					ablutions Bholanath gave alms to the people. Women of the village came to Sakarba’s house with
					various gifts and presents. They congratulated her when they had the darshan of the child.
					Bholanath’s house became a place of pilgrimage!
					Bholanath called an astrologer and had the horoscope of his son prepared. Seeing that the child was
					born in the best possible positions of the planets the astrologer said, “Bholanath! This son of
					yours is a great form of Narayan. He will become very great and will liberate countless people. He
					will be an eloquent speaker like Brihaspati and will spread the bhagvat dharma.”
					After some time Ramanand Swami arrived at Bhadra. Bholanath showed him the horoscope of his son and
					requested him to give him a name. Swami named him ‘Mulji’, gave his blessings and said, “According
					to the blessings of Atmanand Swami, this child is Akshar, the incarnation of the abode of the
					supreme Purushottam Bhagwan who has taken birth in the Sarvar region. And that Purushottam Bhagwan
					will visit your home.”
					Sakarba experienced great joy in having such a gem-like son born to her. Her motherly affection was
					overflowing. At the same time a unique sense of devotion also flowed from her heart when she thought
					about the divine personality of her son. Her heart danced when she saw or embraced Mulji. Anyone who
					saw the serene and moonlike lustre on Mulji’s face felt a divine peace.</p>
				<h3>Childhood Years</h3>
				<p>When Mulji was four years old, he once asked for milk from his mother. Sakarba replied, “Dear son,
					I’ll give it to you after offering it to Thakorji.” On hearing this, Mulji smiled and said, “Mother!
					Thakorji is always present in my heart. When I eat, Thakorji eats with me. When I sleep, Thakorji
					sleeps with me. Therefore, when I drink milk, he too drinks with me.”
					Sakarba was taken by surprise when she heard her son’s childlike words which were profound and
					spiritual. Sakarba offered a glass of milk to Mulji in order to fulfil his desire. Looking at his
					mother, Mulji smiled and drank the milk. Suddenly, at that time, Sakarba looked at Thakorji. She saw
					a thin white line on the lips of the murti, and she realized the truth behind Mulji’s utterance.
					It was 7 March 1789 (Fagan sud 10, Samvat 1845), when suddenly Mulji addressed his mother with zest,
					“Mother! Mother! The sacred thread ceremony of my Bhagwan Purushottam Narayan is being celebrated in
					Ayodhya today. So please sing songs of the sacred thread ceremony.” Sakarba was delighted to hear
					these surprising words from her child.Very often she used to tell the village women who met her on
					the riverbank or came to her home, “My Mulji talks as if he is a great scholar! Sometimes I do not
					even understand what he talks about. Still, I like to listen to his sweet words.” As such, the
					innocent and pious people of the village always took the opportunity to have the darshan and company
					of Mulji.
					****
					Soon, Bholanath and Sakarba were blessed with another son. He was named Sundarji. Very often, while
					playing with Sundarji, Mulji would convey special spiritual talks to him. Once, Mulji was rocking
					the cradle of Sundarji. Mulji stopped the cradle every now and then and talked with Sundarji. “What
					are you talking about?” his mother asked. Mulji replied, “Mother! Mother! I am going to become a
					sadhu and will also make Sundarji a sadhu.”
					Sakarba was speechless. She lifted Sundarji from the cradle, embraced him and then said, “No dear!
					You are not to become a sadhu. Don’t speak such inauspicious words.” On such occasions Sakarba’s
					affectionate nature surfaced, and she looked upon Mulji from the worldly viewpoint.
					****
					Although he was very young, Mulji was very mature. He had a natural disinclination for worldly
					pleasures. Thus, he was never attracted towards eating, drinking and other such material enjoyments.
					He was always engrossed in the devotion and meditation of God. On many occasions he talked about
					Shriji Maharaj and made forecasts about his arrival. He was always absorbed in divine bliss as a
					result of his constant union with his Lord, Parabrahman Purna Purushottam Bhagwan Shri Sahajanand
					Swami. Sometimes people had the darshan of God himself manifest in the form of this child devotee.
					Once, Mulji was engrossed in devotion to God. His father saw him and said, “Mulji! such devotion
					should be practised only when you are old. This is the time for you to eat, play and have fun.”
					Mulji did not utter a word when he heard his father say this. Instead, he simply went out of the
					house. Bholanath was pleased with his obedience. After some time Mulji returned and told his father,
					“You asked me to worship God in old age, but I just went around the village and found that many old
					people are sitting in the square busy gossiping. None of them remember God. So if we wait till old
					age we lose the opportunity of our precious youth. How can we rely on this body?”
					Bholanath’s eyes opened when he heard these words from Mulji which were full of deep understanding.
					He rejoiced in his heart and stopped putting obstacles in the worship of Mulji Bhakta.
					Mulji had a liking for kotha, large berries and tamarind fruits. So whenever he ate these fruits
					Bholanath used to reprimand him. “Mulji! Do we not have wheat, ghee and jaggery in the house that
					you eat such things.” Mulji never replied to this but through such actions everyone could see his
					natural inclination for austerity.
