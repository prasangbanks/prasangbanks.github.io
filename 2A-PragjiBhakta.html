				<h1>Pragji Bhakta</h1>
				<span class="image main"></span>
				<h3>Early Childhood</h3>
				<p>A group of children was chanting the Ram dhun in the mandir courtyard. In the middle a handsome
					little boy was dancing while singing devotional songs. All those visiting the mandir to offer their
					prayers were deeply impressed by the child’s ardent love towards God. They forgot everything else
					and stood there like statues watching this little boy dancing and singing in praise of God. When the
					children stopped singing, the people discovered that the leader of the group was Pragji, known as
					Bhagat, the son of Govindbhai of Mahuva.
					Pragji Bhakta regularly visited this Lakshmi-Narayan mandir with his friends. It was here in front
					of the small shrine of Hanumanji under the pipal tree, that Shriji Maharaj had stayed for three days
					when he was travelling as Nilkanth Varni. The child Pragji Bhakta always served the murti of
					Hanumanji.
					Mahant Suryabharathi was greatly pleased with the devotion of the child. Pragji Bhakta served the
					mahant and attentively listened to the story of Shri Ram and pondered over the high ideals
					exemplified by the great characters of the Ramayan.
					In the luscious green seaside town of Mahuva in Saurashtra, this child devotee was born to a tailor
					family on the full moon day of the bright half of Fagan in Samvat 1885 (Feb.–Mar. 1829 ce). The
					child was very beautiful and luminous and was loved by all.
					The child devotee was sent to the local school, but he was too active to remain within the walls of
					the school. Often, he would run away with other schoolboys to the river Malan that flowed along the
					outskirts of Mahuva. He would sit in the dry areas of the riverbed and talk to his friends, “I have
					studied everything. I have come to worship God and make others worship God.” Young children always
					stayed in his company and everyone had a natural attraction towards Pragji Bhakta.
					Once, a festival dinner was arranged at Pragji’s house. Pragji Bhakta went to his mother and said,
					“Mother, I am terribly hungry. Please give me something to eat.” However, his mother refused to give
					any food as she had not yet sanctified the food by offering it to God. But, when she went out to do
					some work, Pragji Bhakta entered the kitchen and ate all the sweets, weighing 31⁄2 kg. Then he
					climbed up into the loft and slept.
					On returning, his mother was shocked to see the sweets missing. She asked everyone in the house
					about them. She thought that perhaps some stray dog might have eaten the sweets. But, then, Pragji
					Bhakta called out from the loft, “l have eaten all the sweets.” His elder brother chased him, but
					Pragji Bhakta jumped onto the veranda and escaped.
					The story of this feat of little Pragji Bhakta quickly spread throughout the entire town. Everyone
					exclaimed, “He is a miraculous boy!”
					Once, a great sadhu, Sadguru Yoganand Swami, came to the Swaminarayan Mandir in Mahuva. Pragji
					Bhakta, who loved to serve sadhus, met this holy man. He experienced inner peace by the darshan of
					Swami. Pragji Bhakta accepted the vartman from him and became a satsangi. Now, Pragji Bhakta spent
					most of his time in the mandir in the service of the sadhus. Once, he sold a precious lace of his
					mother’s sari to feed the sadhus. Yoganand Swami, who was deeply impressed by the zeal, devotion and
					love of this child observed, “He will be a great devotee.”</p>

				<h3> Meeting Sadguru Gopalanand Swami</h3>
				<p>It was during this period that Acharya Shri Raghuvirji Maharaj and Sadguru Gopalanand Swami visited
					the village of Pithvadi near Mahuva. The Rathods of Pithvadi had especially invited Pragji Bhakta
					from Mahuva to perform pujan of Acharya Maharaj and Swami. A huge assembly of sadhus and devotees
					was organised as per the tradition of Satsang. The ten-year-old Pragji Bhakta had put on beautiful
					clothes for the occasion. He boldly stood before the congregation and performed the pujan of Acharya
					Maharaj and the sadhus, performed arti and then prostrated before them.
					The child caught the attention of Acharya Maharaj. Devotees introduced the child devotee. Sadguru
					Gopalanand Swami, who had been observing the child since he came to the congregation, said, “This
					child is a born devotee.” The devotees asked Swami to say more. Swami replied, “He is very great and
					will inspire thousands of people to worship God.” These words of Swamiji made the child all the more
					loved by the people.
					Pragji Bhakta was instinctively attracted towards the luminous figure of Sadguru Gopalanand Swami.
					From then on he regularly visited Vartal to stay in the company of Gopalanand Swami. He was always
					accompanied by the elderly Jinabhai Rathod of Mahuva, whom he served during their journey. At Vartal
					he always sat by Gopalanand Swami’s side and ate only simple food, like, gram and jaggery. He served
					Gopalanand Swami with great devotion and listened to his discourses with great faith.
					Pragji Bhakta’s love and devotion towards Gopalanand Swami became deeper and more intense. He longed
					for more and more satsang. He desired to stay in the service of Swami all the time. One day he asked
					Swami about this. Swami told him, “One who accepts Shriji Maharaj as the incarnation of all
					incarnations and becomes attached to Gunatitanand Swami, remains constantly in communion with Shriji
					Maharaj and me – whether such a devotee is a renunciate or a householder.”
					This made Pragji Bhakta aware of the greatness and eminence of Gunatitanand Swami, the choicest
					devotee of Shriji Maharaj. But Pragji Bhakta was too deeply attached to Gopalanand Swami to ponder
					over this revelation. Out of his deep love and reverence towards Swami he thought of renouncing the
					worldly life. But Swami commanded him to worship God while remaining as a householder. Once Pragji
					Bhakta went to Mumbai to learn the craft of tailoring. Then, he prepared a beautiful coat and a pair
					of stockings for Acharya Maharaj and went to Vartal to offer them to Acharya Maharaj, who was
					greatly pleased by this.
					As he had great attachment for Gopalanand Swami, Pragji Bhakta often became sad when, in the course
					of his work, he forgot him. Seeing this, Gunatitanand Swami used to tell him, “If you attain jnan
					from the sadhus, then even while leading the life of a householder you will not be able to forget
					God and his holy Sadhu.”
					Overwhelmed by his love, once, Gopalanand Swami told Pragji Bhakta, “Go to Junagadh. All my promises
					to you shall be fulfilled there.”
					In Samvat 1908 (1852 CE) Gopalanand Swami was taken ill at Vartal. The devotees of Vadodara wanted
					him to spend his last days with them. But Swami promptly replied, “Now my attention is towards
					Maharaj in Akshardham or towards the Jogi of Junagadh.”
					Pragji Bhakta requested Swami to explain the significance of his reply. Gopalanand Swami said, “The
					Jogi of Junagadh is himself the manifestation of Akshardham, the dwelling place of Shriji Maharaj.
					He is not even an atom’s width away from Shriji Maharaj.” So saying Gopalanand Swami passed away to
					Akshardham on the fourth day of the dark half of Vaishakh.</p>
