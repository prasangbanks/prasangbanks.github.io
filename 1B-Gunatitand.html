				<h3>Absorbed In The Murti Of Maharaj</h3>
				<p>During his travels, Swami came to Gadhada. Here, Maharaj was breaking his fast of the eleventh day of
					the bright half of Ashadh. He was eating khichdi and yogurt in the room of Vasudev Narayan. All the
					sadhus who were sitting there wished for some prasad from Maharaj. Only Gunatitanand Swami was
					engrossed in the darshan of Maharaj without any such expectation. The all-knowing Maharaj knew that
					Swami was standing there, not for prasad, but for the darshan of his murti. So, Maharaj called Swami
					and expressed his joy by giving him prasad from his thal. All the sadhus thus experienced the unique
					mutual tie of affection between Swami and Maharaj.
					During this time discourses on Ramanuj Bhashya, a commentary on the Bhagvad Gita, were being held in
					Akshar Ordi in the presence of Maharaj and other senior sadgurus. Once, the purani delivered a
					brilliant discourse, so Maharaj embraced him. Seeing this Brahmanand Swami said in a lighter vein,
					“You can’t be so partial. You should embrace everyone present here in the discourse.”
					The news spread that Maharaj would embrace all; so the next day there was a large audience in the
					discourse. Then Maharaj asked Nityanand Swami, “Everyone has come to the discourse, but ask how many
					of them understand it?”
					After the discourse Nityanand Swami asked everyone, and those who did not understand anything were
					requested not to come the next day. He asked Swami also. Swami passionately replied, ‘‘Oh! What a
					discourse! It is unparalleled.” So Swami was permitted to come.
					Thereafter Muktanand Swami asked Swami, “Do you really understand it?” Then Swami replied in the
					same passionate tone, ‘‘I am attracted only by the darshan of Maharaj.”
					Seeing such yearning for darshan, Muktanand Swami was happy.</p>

				<h3>Infinite Faith</h3>
				<p>Swami, the manifest form of Brahman, travelled to reveal the true identity of Purushottam Narayan to
					numerous jivas and to help them overcome maya. In every event of his life it is easy to discern his
					singular devotion towards Shriji Maharaj.
					Once, on his way from Gadhada to Vartal, Maharaj arrived at Barwala with a group of sadhus and
					devotees. Here, devotees offered ladoos to Maharaj and his group. Swami also got one ladoo as his
					share, but he was not interested in it. He was totally engrossed in the murti of Maharaj and craved
					for his darshan every minute. Compared to his enjoyment of the murti of Maharaj, the joys of other
					worldly pleasures did not interest him. When Maharaj travelled from one village to another he often
					went on horseback. So to have his darshan Swami would have to run. Moreover, according to the rules,
					a sadhu could not go alone. Therefore, he would have to have the company of another sadhu who would
					be prepared to run with him.
					So Swami requested one sadhu, “I wish to run with the horse in order to have the darshan of Maharaj.
					If you’ll give me company in running I’ll give you my ladoo.” The sadhu was tempted by the offer and
					consented. In this way, Swami ran backwards through hedges, fields, thorns, etc. without caring for
					his body, remaining constantly engaged in Maharaj’s darshan. Such was the yearning of Swami for
					Maharaj’s darshan!</p>
