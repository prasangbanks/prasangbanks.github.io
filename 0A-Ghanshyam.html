				<h3> Birth of Ghanshyam</h3>
				<p>Chhapaiya is a beautiful little village near Ayodhya, in Uttar Pradesh. All around it there are lots
					of banyan, pipal, mango, tamarind, guava and pomegranate trees. One finds a forest of jambu trees on
					its outskirts. There is a constant chirping of birds. The sweet notes of cuckoos, mena, devchaklis,
					parrots and peacocks, fill the air and enliven the atmosphere. The whole village looks enchanting
					with its tiny streets, and charming mandirs and houses. It is the night of Monday, 3 April 1781
					(Chaitra sud 9, Samvat year 1837). The time is 10 o’clock at night and there is rejoicing in and
					around the house of Dharmadev. Outside the house children are dancing with joy. Women are joyfully
					flocking to Dharmadev’s house, singing and carrying large silver plates filled with kumkum, gulal,
					garlands of flowers and silken clothes in their hands. People are gathering all around the house.
					Outside, the Brahmins are reciting sacred mantras in the yagna arena. Dharmadev is donating
					ornaments, clothes and cows to Brahmins, sages and the poor. Rows of lighted lamps, arranged one
					above the other, give the whole house an enchanting glow. Drums and pipes are playing soulful tunes.
					But why are all these festivities taking place here tonight? Because a son has been born to
					Dharmadev and Bhaktimata. And it is Purna Purushottam Narayan, Supreme God, himself who has been
					born to Bhaktimata. God himself has manifested in the form of this newborn baby. His shining form
					fills the whole house with divine light and joy. Everyone is astonished to see such radiance. The
					devas shower flowers and chandan from the sky. Seated in their heavenly chariots, they fly in to
					have darshan of Dharmadev’s son. Trumpets of victory are sounded all around.</p>
				<h3>Childhood Exploits</h3>
				<p> There was an evil man named Kalidatt. He was foremost among sinners. He became very upset and
					agitated when he learnt that God had taken birth as a baby boy in Dharmadev’s house. One early
					morning, he ordered all his evil women accomplices, “Go to Dharmadev’s house and kill the
					child-God.” So the evil women came to Chhapaiya, and started looking for Dharmadev’s house. The
					demonesses were all extremely dark in colour, with blood-red eyes, big pointed teeth, ugly faces
					and frightful voices. When they found Dharmadev’s house, they peeped in quietly, and saw
					Bhaktimata feeding milk to child-God. They slowly stepped in and, before Bhaktimata realized
					what was happening, quickly lifted the child from her lap and tore away towards the mango grove.
					Hanumanji, son of the wind-god, resided in the mango grove. Seeing evil women carrying the
					child-God away, he at once got up, took a few long jumps and soon caught up with them. He took
					the child from the hands of the old, evil woman who was carry- ing him and then caught hold of
					all the other demonesses, tied their ponytails to his own tail, and lashed it violently against
					the ground. He then pulled some of them by the hair and gave them a sound thrashing. Others, he
					lifted high, whirled them round and round, and finally threw them to the ground. They cried with
					pain, and tears in their eyes, asking for forgiveness, “Please let us go. We shall never again
					come to Chhapaiya.” After their sincere pleas, Hanumanji let them go, and they quickly scampered
					off into the distance. Hanumanji then quickly returned to the village, and gave the child-God to
					Bhaktimata. He prostrated before her, and said,“Mother, your child is God himself, and I am his
					humble servant. Please call me whenever you need my help. I shall be at your service.”
					Bhaktimata, who was stricken with grief, was now greatly relieved. She took the child in her
					lap, pressed him to her bosom, and cuddled him with affection.The evil accomplices returned to
					Kalidatt, and gave a report of what happened. Then they declared with one voice, “We shall never
					again go to Chhapaiya to bring the child-God. He has a servant named Hanuman. This Hanuman
					nearly beat us to death.” On hearing this, Kalidatta became furious. He sent his most senior
					demoness, Kotra, with instructions to kill the child-God. Kotra came and stood before
					Dharmadev’s house. She waited for the child-God to be left alone. But the Lord is all knowing.
					He looked at Kotra from the corner of his eyes and she started burning instantly. “I am burning,
					I am dying,” she screamed. Thus shrieking and struggling to douse the flames, she died on the
					spot. And so Kotra, though as powerful as a giant, was within a short time, destroyed by the
					Lord. The children of the village were afraid on seeing Kotra’s dead body. Everyone was
					speechless with fright. They all wondered as to how such an evil woman could </p>
