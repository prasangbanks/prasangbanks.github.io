				<h1>Mahant Swami Maharaj</h1>
				<h3>Present Life</h3>
				<p>In 1961, on the occasion of the Kalash Mahotsav of the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Gadhada, Yogiji
					Maharaj gave bhagwati (saffron) diksha to 51 educated youths. Among them, Vinu Bhagat was named
					Swami Keshavjivandas. Thereafter, Yogiji Maharaj instructed the 51 newly initiated sadhus to study
					Sanskrit in Mumbai. Swami Keshavjivandas was appointed as their head ('mahant') at Dadar Mandir.
					Hence, over time, he became respectfully known as Mahant Swami.
					His outstanding virtues of austerity, self-control, devotion, humility and service earned him the
					blessings and joy of Yogiji Maharaj and Pramukh Swami Maharaj. In 1971, after the earthly departure
					of Yogiji Maharaj, he totally dedicated himself to Pramukh Swami Maharaj, the new guru, with the
					same devotion and allegiance he had for guru Yogiji Maharaj. His exposure to Pramukh Swami Maharaj’s
					pure saintliness and spiritual loftiness had begun in 1951, when he first met him. Since 1971, as
					per the wishes and instructions of HH Pramukh Swami Maharaj, he has relentlessly travelled
					throughout India and abroad to inspire and strengthen satsang in countless devotees. He has also
					offered his services during the Sanstha’s mega-festivals, in children and youth activities, the
					Akshardham projects, and other satsang activities.
					HH Mahant Swami’s profound discourses have enlightened countless devotees and well-wishers and
					motivated them to adopt pious, addiction-free lives. His saintliness and devotion to Bhagwan
					Swaminarayan and gurus Yogiji Maharaj and Pramukh Swami Maharaj have left a lasting impression on
					innumerable devotees.
					On 20 July 2012, in the presence of senior sadhus in Ahmedabad, Pramukh Swami Maharaj revealed
					Mahant Swami as his spiritual successor. Following the earthly departure of Pramukh Swami Maharaj on
					13 August 2016, Mahant Swami became the sixth guru in the Gunatit Parampara tradition of Bhagwan
					Swaminarayan. HH Mahant Swami Maharaj now presides as the guru and spiritual guide of countless
					devotees and helms the worldwide socio-spiritual activities of BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha.</p>
